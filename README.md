QML for Conspicuity Detection in Production

This project aims to enhance conspicuity detection in production, allowing for the early identification of improvement measures for individual work steps or sub-processes, thus optimizing the production process. By analyzing process data such as image data or time series, the project seeks to uncover deviations and weak points. Given the time-consuming nature of classical data analysis methods, the project explores the potential of hybrid quantum computing to accelerate this process. The focus is on implementing hybrid quantum algorithms and benchmarking them against classical approaches, including machine learning and statistical methods.
