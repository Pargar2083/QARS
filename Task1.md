We started our journey on Pennylane in the first week after the first Xanadu lecture.
Of course we went for the codebook without hesitation. We didn't expect much, as we thought it would be the same as other package or library documentation, full of crammed up and confusing information, with some complex page layout.
But oh boy we were so wrong.
We were greeted with a simple and friendly design (complemented by the adorable hand-drawn pictures and circuits); all the content was organised into distinguishable sections such as the intro, single qubit gates, circuits, and more.
This was a very good impression because from our previous experiences, documentations and tutorials were usually grouped into many simple drop-down menus with complications such as where do we start first and all.
The best part was that the page had a section for new content! Notifying us about what new knowledge we could learn; not to mention right beside it there was a progress system, showing you were in the codebook you were. Amazing feature! Because we kept getting lost where we were in other tutorials.

The lessons were extremely well-designed. The layout of the pages where the left-hand side was coding exercises and the right-hand theoretical, made it very easy on the eyes and navigatable.
The contents of the Introduction section were a breeze, as we learned most of them in previous courses like QBronze.
Learning the syntax of Pennylane (or qml) took some time since we had to also initiate extra things like devices, wires, qnodes, etc., but the overall circuit development was pretty much similar to Qiskit and Cirq.

Another plus for Pennylane is the ability to apply arbitrary unitaries we design, which makes circuit design much easier.

Other lessons (various gates, quantum mechanics, algorithms, etc.) were just implementing what we knew from Qiskit and Cirq, but with Pennylane; so everything we learned went perfectly smoothly.
